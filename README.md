# Gratitude Journal  
A simple, heartfelt app to log daily moments of gratitude and build a mindful habit.

## 🧡 Why this exists  
Life moves fast. We often overlook the small things that bring us joy, calm, or meaning.  
This app is built to give you a gentle space—to pause, reflect, and write down one thing you’re grateful for.  
Over time, those little notes add up. You’ll look back and see a trail of what matters.  
No fluff. Just you, your thoughts, and the habit.

## ✨ What the app does  
- Allows you to **create a daily gratitude entry** — quick, simple, meaningful.  
- Stores your entries so you can **review your journey**, revisit good days, and reflect.  
- Encourages consistency so you build a habit of gratitude.  
- Focuses on clean, minimal design: no distractions, just reflection.

*(If you have more features like export, reminders, tags, theming — add them here.)*
